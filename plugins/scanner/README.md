## Config
In `config.rs`, there are the following constants. In order to avoid occupying too much system resources, it is recommended to use the default parameters.

### Plugin Config
```
const SOCKET_PATH:&str = ../../plugin.sock";
const NAME:&str = "scanner";
const VERSION:&str = "0.0.0.0";
```
These can be configured as required, but remember those constants need to be consistent with the [agent's parameters ](../README.md#parameters-and-options) and [agent's config.yaml](../README.md#config-file).

### Scan config
* `SCAN_DIR_CONFIG` define the scan directory list and recursion depth
* `SCAN_DIR_FILTER` define the filter directory list matched by prefix

### Performance limit config
* `LOAD_MMAP_MAX_SIZE` define the maximum file size of scanned files (skip large files)
* `WAIT_INTERVAL_DAILY` define the interval of each round of scanning
* `WAIT_INTERVAL_DIR_SCAN` define the interval between scanning directories
* `WAIT_INTERVAL_PROC_SCAN` define the interval between scanning processes


### [Yara Rules](https://yara.readthedocs.io/en/stable/writingrules.html)
`RULES_SET` define the yara rule string.

Current rules for reference:
* UPX-elf
* miner stratum elf/script
* suspicious script
